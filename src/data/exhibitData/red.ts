                'successes included damaging the production of ammunition, eliminating Germany’s sources of nitrate, and the ' +

                'bombs were dropped on Japanese targets throughout the war, including 160,800 tons dropped on the home ' +
                'islands. During early bombing raids, using high-altitude precision bombing, only 10% of the bombs fell near ' +
                'their targets. When they switched to low-level night-time incendiary attacks, the raids were more effective: ' +

                'manufacturing, but production was dropped by 54% as a result of loss of factory workers and destruction of ' +
                'transportation methods.'
