        'In order to accomplish strategic bombing and other aviation-delivered goals, a nation must possess strategic ' +
        'aviation logistics; specifically, the capability to deliver humans, equipment, and materials sufficient to conduct ' +
        'desired operations. This requires major airfields, material handling equipment, and all the critical infrastructure ' +
        'required to support organizational objectives. During WW II, this meant building small airfields in remote areas ' +
        'with light capabilities, then expanding those capabilities selectively to develop greater reach and ordnance ' +
        'delivery capability. Such was accomplished by both “The Hump”, explained in greater detail later, and the ' +
        'famous naval Pacific “Island Hopping” Campaign, whereby islands of lesser importance were cut off as US ' +
        'forces selectively secured larger islands to develop strategic airfields capable of reaching Japan’s home ' +
        'islands. This was more than a mere evolution of European Theater experience, rather, a synthesis of Chinese - ' +
        'Burma, European, African, and other theaters of war multiplied by new capabilities brought to bear by the ' +
        'USAAF. Production techniques and capacity increased dramatically as the war progressed. US infrastructure ' +
        'remained untouched, setting conditions for maximization of advances. Lessons learned were captured and ' +
        'applied in turn to every measure of American war might, resulting in long-distance platforms like the C-54 ' +
        'Skymaster cargo aircraft and the B-29 Superfortress long range bomber. Combining strategic intelligence, ' +
        'target selection, and ordnance application in an environment supported by better fighter escorts ensured ' +
        'dramatic effects on enemy war making capabilities. These and other advances eventually set conditions to ' +
        'deliver the most powerful ordnance used in wartime - the atomic bombs.'
