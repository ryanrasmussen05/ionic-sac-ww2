        'As the interwar years faded, an introspective post-WWI Germany as well as the developed ' +
        'world continued aviation experimentation, to include expansion of passenger service, military ' +
        'application of aerial capabilities, and advances in aeronautical engineering. While some nations ' +
        'lagged due to a lack of urgency, European countries and Japan, were interested in expanding ' +
        'their spheres of influence, recognized the utility of aviation in military affairs. Tactics employing ' +
        'the delivery of ordnance from aircraft in direct support of decisive ground forces were ' +
        'developed. These methods were tested by the Germans in the Spanish Civil War 1933-1936. ' +
        'Germany and many other nations recognized the potential utility of medium and light bombing ' +
        'aircraft. Britain and the United States began to explore heavier aircraft, flying at higher altitudes ' +
        'with larger payloads, as well as, developing better bomb-sighting methods.'
