        'The Blue Room depicts some of the early days of aviation and initial bombing capabilities of a variety of air forces. Small ' +
        'aircraft generally performed reconnaissance missions in support of ground commanders who understood that aerial observation of their ground ' +
        'deployments and posture could compromise operations. From this was born fighter aircraft whose duty it was to prevent other aircraft from ' +
        'observing and reporting on troop dispositions. During this period some small aircraft pilots carried grenades and mortar shells that they ' +
        'dropped over the side on ground targets, leading to better ways to put heavier ordnance on target. Eventually larger period bomber aircraft ' +
        'carried small bomb loads at low altitudes and generally attacked area targets such as large troop formations. These larger aircraft were ' +
        'vulnerable to smaller, faster fighters.'
